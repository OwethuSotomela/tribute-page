                            <br>
                        <ol>Many called him Leuw and I called him boet because he was just like any other ordinary guy.
                            Never have I felt like my father's daughter because he had long escaped his responsiblity,
                            me.</ol>
                        <ol>Many who knew him personally knew that he was full of life and he lived his life to the
                            fullest.</ol>
                        <ol>At some point while growing up he was an activist and fought against unequal treatment
                            between blacks and whites from the apartheid government.</ol>
                        <ol>He left behind seven children (five girls and two boys), with me being the eldest of them.
                        </ol>
                        <ol>His cause of death was the persistent illness that resulted from cigarrette smoking and
                            alcohol intoxication, he was coughing blood and having hard time breathing as his lungs were
                            badly affected. </ol>
